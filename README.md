# Haskell Undefined Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Haskell: using an undefined variable. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version.

The bug arises from attempting to perform an arithmetic operation on a variable that hasn't been assigned a value.  This leads to a runtime exception, halting program execution.

The solution emphasizes the importance of proper variable initialization in Haskell before usage to avoid this type of error.
